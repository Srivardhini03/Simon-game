The simon game build with HTML, CSS, JS, and jQuery library.

## SIMON GAME

 This game is extremely basic, and you just press any key to start the game which triggers the game mechanism that beeps one of the four colored boxes on the screen. The beeped box goes into an array which stores the sequence of color buttons to be pressed. The user then has to copy that particular sequence and once the full sequence has been copied another colored button gets added to that sequence making the sequence longer as each level progresses. The user can make upto as many stages as they are able to.

I added sounds to the game upon button pressing and gameover sound when the player loses the game. All the sound files are available in the sounds folder.

#### Run Instructions: 
You can download the files and open index.html with a browser

### Rules
There are 4 color boxes , each on clicking will produce it's own distinct tune. When you click start , the boxes start to get highlighted and randomly makes it's own tune. The aim is to recreate the sequence produced by clicking manually. A level you are in is provided based on the streak, and when you miss one, the streak is gone and you will lose the game.
